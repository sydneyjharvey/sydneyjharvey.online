        <p>My name is Sydney Harvey, and I am a sophomore in the IDM program. I’ve lived all of my life in central Jersey with my parents and brothers. Growing up, I’ve always had a thirst for knowledge and a desire to learn about anything I could. I would spend my nights pouring over informational books about space, science, culture, and many other things. I constantly found myself new hobbies to intently research and tackle. Painting, sewing, visual effects, coding, and music, where I was involved in my high school’s marching band for the full four years, are just a few of the crafts that I’ve learnt some of. While I wouldn’t call myself an expert in most of these, I feel that having a variety of knowledge like this has helped me in a variety of unexpected ways.</p>
        <p>I’ve always loved drawing and designing, and have been practicing and improving as long as I can remember. I’ve enjoyed experimenting with various mediums, including acrylic, watercolors, alcohol markers, and digital art softwares. Nowadays I promote my art online through social media, and have been involved in a few collaborative projects creating joint pieces. Most of my artwork consists of character and conceptual design, which led to me getting into costume design and sewing, as well as visual effects. I’m fascinated by the use of prosthetics and paints on actors in movies to produce life-like effects, and have taught myself to mold and cast my own prosthetics.</p>
        <p>During high school, I was in my high school’s marching band playing the trumpet. During that time I learned a lot about working with a team both large and small. The ten or so trumpets that the band had most years all needed to work together to learn the music, the steps, and collaborate on who plays which parts were played by who. Beyond that the entire band, which consisted of around seventy people not including the percussion, battery, and color guard, all needed to collaborate closely for the quality of the music and the show, as well as for safety to make sure no body got seriously hurt. During these years we won top marks in competitions, and won first place in the state competition in fall of 2019. During those years, I also took classes on wiring and coding. I learnt circuitry, as well as the basics of python, HTML, CSS, and swift, coding a few basic programs to run a game of blackjack and tic-tac-toe, as well as a basic one-page website.</p>
        <p>My main goal for the future is to apply my love of design to user experience, and earn a job in the field where my past experience can help my future team. While I am not certain exactly where I want to end up, I aim to continue learning about the various paths I can take in a UXID-related job space. I am excited to begin co-op in the spring and summer, to gain work experience related to my major. While I have learnt HTML and CSS some, my experience is still very limited, and the class I took was stifled due to the beginning of Covid hitting right in the middle of it. None the less, I can not wait to take this class and learn as much as I can.</p>
